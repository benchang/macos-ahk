# macos-ahk
A set of simple AutoHotkey shortcut/hotkey proxies for macOS users to survive on windows harsh environment.

## Who

This script might be useful for people that mainly work/live in macOS environment, and are used to hotkeys which are used mainly for text editing (Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code), and general purpose use cases.

## Why

<sup>my personal opinion:</sup>  
After working with macOS hotkeys for a year or more, is hard (or even painfull) to go back to windows hotkeys. Editing code/text files is the biggest issue. Any attempt to configure it on system side has failed (at least for me).

## How to use

1. Make sure you have AutoHotkey installed
2. Download the script
3. Place it somewhere nice
4. Double click
